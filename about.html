                <p>After living on the West Coast all my life, I moved to Chicago as an Americorp VISTA for Illinois Tech's Global Leader's Program. Here, I became passionate about using technology to increase student's exposure to STEM in their backyard and enrolled in a post-baccalaureate Web Design & App Development Program at IIT. When I'm not eating Chicago's carb-loaded food, volunteering with my faith community, or trying to burn off said food, I'm developing apps that connect people, increase opportunity, or learn useful skills.</p>
